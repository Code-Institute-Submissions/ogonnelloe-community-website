            <h1>Ballyloughnane ringfort</h1>
            <p>Ballyloughnane ringfort is located close to St. Mary’s Church.  The recorded ringforts in County Clare mostly date from the early Christian /early medieval period (500-900A.D)[4] although some may have been in use centuries later.  The 1840s description of Ballyloughnane ringfort indicates that it was about two and a quarter chains in diameter, having a stone and earthen bank five feet high, with a green flat surface.[5]  Interestingly it was described as having a souterrain or a cave extending into a cultivated field to its north.  No local knowledge is available concerning the existence of this souterrain. The ringfort itself is generally in good condition with the wide stone/earthen bank mostly intact.</p>

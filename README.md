### Design

I want the design of the website to inform and empower the vistors to access useable information relating to Ogonnelloe. I want to keep the design and navigation simple to ensure it is accessable to all ages. I want to make the site responsive in order for it to be accessable on a range of devices. I want to make this website a tool for people to use to get more involved in the community of Ogonnlloe. 

  - #### Color scheme
    - The primary and secondary colours I have chosen to use are black (`#FFC125`) and amber (`#000000`). These are the colours on the Ogonnelloe flag. These colours are very bold so I wanted to offset this with light colours to highlight certain areas. These colours were light grey (`#D2D5DD`), cadet (`#637074`), and ghost white (`#F7F7FF`).
    - The amber colour was found using the color selector on chrome dev tools. I used the selector to find the shade of each color that I felt complimented the site well and fitted with the bands look.![alt text](assets/images/readme-imgs/colour-pallette.png)

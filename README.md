### Ogonnelloe GAA Website
---
[View the live project here.](https://sean-meade.github.io/ogonnelloe-community-website/)

This is a website project for the members of the GAA in the community of Ogonnelloe. It is designed to be responsive and accessible on a range of devices, making it easy to navigate for current or potential members. This website was built for my first project for the softwre development course for code institute.

OgonnelloeGAA.com is a site that hopes to end the confusion for players. Growing up there has always been confusion about training times, events, and news about the club. What time is training? 8pm ... John said it was 7pm this week. When is that fundraiser on? Mam said it was Saturday week but Dad swears it was Friday. Who won player of the match there on the weekend? Susan ... No way had to be Elaine! 

This has been a common acurance. So OgonnelloeGAA.com is set to remove all doubts. It has an input field for email sign up for the newsletter, which contains the upcoming events. The Training page lays out the training times for the club for the different age groups. The news and events page lays out some of the top stories involving the club currently. Finally, there is a contact page to make it easy to request information from the club. Players are just going to have to find other things to argue over because all their questions will be answered!


The orignal scope for this website was to be a community website. It turns out however that a community (even if you think it's small) is massive. So I have decided to focus on one corner stone of our community of Ogonnelloe; the Gaielge Athletic Association.

### Design

I want the design of the website to inform and empower the vistors to access useable information relating to Ogonnelloe. I want to keep the design and navigation simple to ensure it is accessable to all ages. I want to make the site responsive in order for it to be accessable on a range of devices. I want to make this website a tool for people to use to get more involved in the community of Ogonnlloe. 

  - #### Color scheme
    - The primary and secondary colours I have chosen to use are black (`#FFC125`) and amber (`#000000`). These are the colours on the Ogonnelloe flag. These colours are very bold so I wanted to offset this with light colours to highlight certain areas. These colours were light grey (`#D2D5DD`), cadet (`#637074`), and ghost white (`#F7F7FF`).
    - The amber colour was found using the color selector on chrome dev tools. I used the selector to find the shade of each color that I felt complimented the site well and fitted with the bands look.![alt text](assets/images/readme-imgs/colour-pallette.png)
